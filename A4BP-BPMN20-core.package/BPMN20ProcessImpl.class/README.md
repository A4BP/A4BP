A Process describes a sequence or flow of Activities in an organization with the objective of carrying out work. In BPMN a Process is depicted as a graph of Flow Elements, which are a set of Activities, Events, Gateways, and Sequence Flows that define finite execution semantics. Processes can be defined at any level from enterprise-wide Processes to Processes performed by a single person. Low-level Processes can be grouped together to achieve a common business goal.

A Process is a CallableElement, allowing it to be referenced and reused by other Processes via the Call Activity
construct. In this capacity, a Process MAY reference a set of Interfaces that define its external behavior.

A Process is a reusable element and can be imported and used within other Definitions.
